Why Itâ€™s Important 

The issue of plastic pollution and reducing it by using alternative materials is important to the team because of a mutual passion for environmental issues. Everyone in the team cares for the health of the environment and understands the negative impacts of plastic. All team members strive to find a cost-effective, sustainable alternative for most plastic uses.  

It is important to research this topic because of the prevalence of plastic waste in the world. Plastic is a material that is not biodegradable and will only break down into microplastics. This is not only harmful to the environment; human health is at risk as well. Consuming microplastics is likely to cause negative health problems, as it is already prevalent for other animal species. Plastic alternatives need to be researched for the improved health of the planet and all those who live on it.
